## File Conflict Zones

| Zone | Files | Rows affected | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|-------|---------------|----------|------------|
| Phase 5 | `bin/rws`, `bin/frw.d/` | cli-architecture, folder-structure | medium | cli-architecture merges first |
| Phase 6 | `skills/`, `commands/` | orchestration-polish, harness-lifecycle-ux | low | different subsystems within shared dirs |

## Phase 1 — Install & Merge Foundation — PLANNED

Recurring commit/merge issues across this repo and consumer projects. Two parallel rows: `install-and-merge` (install architecture + `/furrow:merge` skill + reintegration summary, all sharing `bin/frw.d/` hook surface) and `post-ship-reexamination` (watch-list + decision-review TODO type — structurally decoupled primitive for post-evidence re-examination).

**Parallelism**: `install-and-merge || post-ship-reexamination`

### work/install-and-merge (4 TODOs, ~5 sessions)

- `install-architecture-overhaul` — Install architecture — self-hosting, symlink hygiene, commit safety
- `config-cleanup` — ~/.config/furrow/ tier, 3-tier resolution chain, migration path
- `merge-process-skill` — Design a /furrow:merge skill — reconcile worktree branches back into main
- `worktree-reintegration-summary` — Produce summary for worktree reintegration (the /furrow:merge output)

- **Key files**: `install.sh`, `bin/frw.d/install.sh`, `bin/frw.d/scripts/launch-phase.sh`, `bin/frw.d/hooks/`, `bin/frw.d/lib/common.sh`, `bin/frw`, `commands/`, `commands/next.md`, `skills/implement.md`, `skills/shared/context-isolation.md`, `.furrow/`
- **Conflict risk**: none
- **Why together**: install-architecture fixes the hook-cascade lockout and sets the "install residue" patterns that `/furrow:merge` needs to reject; the reintegration summary IS the `/furrow:merge` output. All four share `bin/frw.d/` hook surface so splitting would force coordination.

### work/post-ship-reexamination (2 TODOs, ~2 sessions)

- `post-merge-watch-list` — Post-merge watch-list — track behavioral signals to validate after rows merge
- `decision-review-todo-type` — Decision-review TODO type — structured post-evidence re-examination triggers

- **Key files**: `.furrow/almanac/`, `bin/alm`, `schemas/todos.schema.yaml`, `skills/review.md`, `skills/shared/summary-protocol.md`
- **Conflict risk**: none (fully decoupled from install-and-merge)
- **Why together**: Both design a structured primitive for "after X ships, re-examine Y." Watch-list is almanac-level; decision-review is TODO-schema-level — unifying the design may produce one primitive instead of two competing ones.

## Phase 2 — Almanac Graph, Seeds, and Promotion — PLANNED

Foundational graph primitives, seed concept, and the promotion system that graduates row-level knowledge up the tier chain. Consolidated into one row because the previous split couldn't actually parallelize — both rewrite `bin/alm` and `.furrow/almanac/`. Building them together means the graph design accommodates promotion from day 1.

### work/almanac-graph-and-promotion (3 TODOs, ~7 sessions)

- `almanac-graph-primitives`
- `seeds-concept`
- `ambient-context-promotion`

- **Key files**: `bin/alm`, `bin/sds`, `.furrow/almanac/`, `skills/`, `references/`, `commands/lib/`
- **Conflict risk**: none
- **Why together**: Seed graph IS the almanac graph engine; promotion is the use case that validates the graph primitives. One primitive, one branch.

## Phase 3 — Review & Specialist System — PLANNED

Unify review machinery and raise specialist quality bar before downstream command changes consume reviews and specialists.

### work/review-unification (2 TODOs, ~3 sessions)

- `unified-isolated-review`
- `gate-dimension-deduplication`

- **Key files**: `bin/frw.d/scripts/cross-model-review.sh`, `skills/review.md`, `skills/ideate.md`, `skills/shared/eval-protocol.md`, `commands/review.md`, `evals/gates/`, `evals/dimensions/`
- **Conflict risk**: low
- **Why together**: Both restructure how reviews are invoked and how gate dimensions compose — one branch keeps the review contract consistent.

### work/specialist-quality (4 TODOs, ~4 sessions)

- `specialist-template-warning-escalation`
- `specialist-quality-validation`
- `apply-nate-jones-skill`
- `effort-selection-alongside-model` — effort_hint frontmatter alongside model_hint

- **Key files**: `specialists/`, `references/specialist-template.md`, `skills/implement.md`, `skills/`, `bin/frw.d/scripts/`
- **Conflict risk**: low
- **Why together**: All four address the specialist metadata + quality bar — template enforcement, validation, applied skill patterns, and effort-alongside-model frontmatter. Grouping effort_hint here (from Phase 6 orchestration-polish) keeps specialist-frontmatter changes atomic.

## Phase 4 — Command Pipeline & Planning UX — PLANNED

Command layer matures after agent wiring, reviews, and graph primitives stabilize. Planning UX shares `commands/` but different files.

### work/command-pipeline (4 TODOs, ~3 sessions)

- `brain-dump-triage-command`
- `todo-context-references`
- `roadmap-todo-integration`
- `research-documentation-detection`

- **Key files**: `commands/`, `commands/work-todos.md`, `commands/triage.md`, `commands/next.md`, `bin/alm`, `skills/review.md`
- **Conflict risk**: low
- **Why together**: Command-surface changes for brain-dump, TODO, and roadmap flow — consolidate for atomic UX. (decision-review-todo-type moved to Phase 1 with post-merge-watch-list.)

### work/planning-ux (3 TODOs, ~3 sessions)

- `triage-and-braindump-ideation`
- `furrow-next-phase-lifecycle`
- `research-methodology-design`

- **Key files**: `commands/triage.md`, `commands/next.md`, `bin/frw.d/scripts/launch-phase.sh`, `skills/research.md`
- **Conflict risk**: low
- **Why together**: Planning-loop ergonomics across triage, next-phase handoff, and research methodology.

## Phase 5 — CLI Architecture & Folder Cleanup — PLANNED

CLI architecture decision gates downstream lifecycle UX. cli-architecture merges first to stabilize `bin/` boundaries before folder restructure.

### work/cli-architecture (3 TODOs, ~4 sessions)

- `cli-architecture-overhaul`
- `cli-breakup-script-guard`
- `register-deliverable-command`

- **Key files**: `bin/alm`, `bin/rws`, `bin/sds`, `bin/frw.d/scripts/`, `bin/frw.d/hooks/script-guard.sh`
- **Conflict risk**: medium
- **Why together**: All three restructure the CLI surface — overhauling architecture, breaking up the guard, and filling a command gap.

### work/folder-structure (1 TODO, ~2 sessions)

- `work-folder-structure-and-cleanup`

- **Key files**: `bin/rws`, `commands/archive.md`, `references/row-layout.md`
- **Conflict risk**: low
- **Why together**: Single-TODO row; focused on `.furrow/rows/` growth management. (config-cleanup moved to Phase 1 since it's fundamentally about install architecture.)

## Phase 6 — Orchestration & Lifecycle — PLANNED

Polish orchestration patterns, add sprint/spike modes, and land lifecycle-UX verb renames. Four rows run in parallel; mostly distinct subsystems.

### work/orchestration-polish (3 TODOs, ~2 sessions)

- `parallel-agent-orchestration-adoption`
- `re-evaluate-dispatch-enforcement`
- `user-action-integration`

- **Key files**: `skills/implement.md`, `skills/shared/context-isolation.md`, `bin/rws`, `skills/shared/user-actions.md`
- **Conflict risk**: low
- **Why together**: Orchestrator dispatch lifecycle and user-action integration. (worktree-reintegration-summary moved to Phase 1 with merge-process-skill; effort-selection moved to Phase 3 specialist-quality.)

### work/sprint-and-spikes (2 TODOs, ~4 sessions)

- `sprint-inspired-planning`
- `spike-row-mode`

- **Key files**: `skills/`, `evals/dimensions/`, `.furrow/almanac/`, `commands/triage.md`
- **Conflict risk**: low
- **Why together**: Both are planning-mode variants.

### work/harness-lifecycle-ux (1 TODO, ~4 sessions)

- `harness-lifecycle-ux`

- **Key files**: `commands/`, `skills/`, `install.sh`, `.claude/settings.json`
- **Conflict risk**: low

### work/collaborative-surfaces (1 TODO, ~3 sessions)

- `collaborative-surfaces`

- **Key files**: `skills/`, `adapters/`
- **Conflict risk**: none

## Phase 7 — Audits & Exploration — PLANNED

Low-urgency items. Insights feed back into earlier work. TUI is aspirational.

### work/audits-and-mining (3 TODOs, ~4 sessions)

- `adapters-audit`
- `mine-v1-harness`
- `mine-claude-code`

- **Key files**: `adapters/`, `evals/`, `references/specialist-template.md`
- **Conflict risk**: none

### work/exploratory-research (2 TODOs, ~3 sessions)

- `memetic-algorithms-research`
- `design-pattern-context-construction`

- **Key files**: `references/`, `docs/`
- **Conflict risk**: none

### work/furrow-tui (1 TODO, ~3 sessions)

- `furrow-tui-dashboard`

- **Conflict risk**: none
